  \subsection*{Luck}
  \textbf{Granted Powers:} You are infused with luck, and your
mere presence can spread good fortune.

  \emph{Bit of Luck (Sp):} You can touch a willing creature as a
  standard action, giving it a bit of luck. For the next round,
  any time the target rolls a d20, he may roll twice and take
  the more favorable result. You can use this ability a number
  of times per day equal to $3 +$ your Wisdom modifier.
  
  \emph{Good Fortune (Ex):} At 6th level, as an immediate action,
  you can reroll any one d20 roll you have just made before
  the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result
  of the reroll, even if itâ€™s worse than the original roll. You can
  use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional
  time per day for every six cleric levels beyond 6th.
  
  \textbf{Domain Spells:} 1st-true strike, 2nd-aid, 3rd-
  protection from energy, 4th-freedom of movement, 5th-break
  enchantment, 6th-mislead, 7th-spell turning, 8th-moment
  of prescience, 9th-miracle.
  
  \subsection*{Travel}
  \textbf{Granted Powers:} You are an explorer and find
  enlightenment in the simple joy of travel, be it by foot or
  conveyance or magic. Increase your base speed by 10 feet.
  
  \emph{Agile Feet (Su):} As a free action, you can gain increased
  mobility for 1 round. For the next round, you ignore all
  difficult terrain and do not take any penalties for moving
  through it. You can use this ability a number of times per
  day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
  
  \emph{Dimensional Hop (Sp):} At 8th level, you can teleport up
  to 10 feet per cleric level per day as a move action. This
  teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such
  movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You
  must have line of sight to your destination to use this
  ability. You can bring other willing creatures with you,
  but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each
  creature brought.
  
  \textbf{Domain Spells:} 1st-longstrider, 2nd-locate object, 3rd-
  fly, 4th-dimension door, 5th-teleport, 6th-find the path,
  7th-greater teleport, 8th-phase door, 9th-astral projection.

    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
    
    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the item or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make \mbox{Knowledge (arcana)} skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).
    
    Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
    
    Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.
    
    Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a migac item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

    Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if the are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
    
    Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
