  \section*{Domains}
  \subsection*{Luck}
  \textbf{Granted Powers:} You are infused with luck, and your
mere presence can spread good fortune.

  \emph{Bit of Luck (Sp):} You can touch a willing creature as a
  standard action, giving it a bit of luck. For the next round,
  any time the target rolls a d20, he may roll twice and take
  the more favorable result. You can use this ability a number
  of times per day equal to $3 +$ your Wisdom modifier.
  
  \emph{Good Fortune (Ex):} At 6th level, as an immediate action,
  you can reroll any one d20 roll you have just made before
  the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result
  of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. You can
  use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional
  time per day for every six cleric levels beyond 6th.
  
  \textbf{Domain Spells:} 1st-true strike, 2nd-aid, 3rd-
  protection from energy, 4th-freedom of movement, 5th-break

  day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
  
  \emph{Dimensional Hop (Sp):} At 8th level, you can teleport up

  teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such

  but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each
  creature brought.

    \spelldescription{You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 
    
    1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
    
    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
    
    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the item or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make \mbox{Knowledge (arcana)} skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).
    
    Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.
    
    Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.
    
    Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a migac item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:
    
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Original Strength   & Duration of Lingering Aura\\

        Moderate        & 1d6 minutes\\
        Strong          & 1d6$\times$10 minutes\\
        Overwhelming    & 1d6 days\\

    Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if the are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
    
    Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

    \spelldescription{You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. The ability ot read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.
    
    Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, through the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as secret page and illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.
    
    Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell.}

    \emph{1st Round:} Presence or absence of evil.
    
    \emph{2nd Round:} Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present.
    
    If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
    
    \emph{3rd Round:} The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
    
    \emph{Aura Power:} An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the table on the previous page. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. 
    
    \emph{Lingering Aura:} An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or its destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

    Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Creatures with actively evil intents count as evil creatures for the purpose of this spell.
    
    Each round you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheat of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
